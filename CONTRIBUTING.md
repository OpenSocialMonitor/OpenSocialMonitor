# Contributing to OpenSocialMonitor

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to OpenSocialMonitor! This project aims to provide transparency in social media manipulation, and every contribution helps make that goal a reality.

## About the Maintainer

I'm passionate about combating misinformation and promoting transparency online, but I want to be upfront that my coding skills without AI assistance are limited. I'm learning as I go and rely on tools like Claude to help review and understand complex code.

**What this means for contributors:**
- I review pull requests once a week (typically on weekends)
- I may ask more questions to understand your code changes
- Complex changes might take longer to review and merge
- Your patience and clear explanations are greatly appreciated

I'm actively looking for co-maintainers and regular contributors with stronger technical skills to help this project reach its full potential. If you're interested in a more significant role in the project, please reach out!

## How You Can Help

4. **Make your changes** and commit them
5. **Push your changes** to your fork
6. **Submit a pull request** to the main repository

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code adheres to the project's style and structure
2. Update documentation to reflect any changes you've made
3. Include a clear description of what your changes do and why
4. Link any related issues that your PR addresses
5. Be responsive to feedback and questions about your contribution

## Code Guidelines
