# OpenSocialMonitor

**OpenSocialMonitor** is an open-source toolkit for detecting and monitoring automated manipulation on social media platforms. By identifying bot accounts and coordinated inauthentic behavior, it helps combat misinformation and manipulation campaigns.

## üìä Why This Matters

Social media platforms have become battlegrounds where automated accounts manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation. This manipulation:

- Undermines democratic discourse
- Amplifies extremist viewpoints
- Creates false perception of consensus
- Overwhelms genuine user engagement

OpenSocialMonitor provides transparent, community-driven tools to expose this manipulation and level the playing field. This project takes no political stance - we believe people should be free to vote for and support any candidate or cause they choose. However, we also believe society has a responsibility to ensure everyone can form their opinions based on authentic information, not automated manipulation or coordinated disinformation campaigns.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning

Please be aware that frequent API calls or automated interactions with social media platforms may trigger their anti-scraping measures or be interpreted as suspicious activity. This could potentially lead to rate limiting, temporary blocks, or even permanent suspension of your account.

**Recommendation:** Do not use your personal social media accounts with this tool. Instead, create dedicated accounts specifically for monitoring purposes. This separation helps protect your personal accounts and online presence.

Additionally, be mindful of API rate limits and implement reasonable delays between requests to minimize the risk of being flagged by platform security systems.

## üöÄ Features

- **Bot Detection**: Identifies potential automated accounts using behavioral and linguistic markers
- **Coordination Detection**: Discovers networks of accounts working together to spread identical content
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Initially focused on Instagram, with architecture to expand to other platforms
- **Warning System**: Alerts users about potential manipulation through reply comments
- **Open & Transparent**: All detection methods are open to scrutiny and improvement

## üìã Making Real-World Impact

### Empower Yourself and Your Community

In a world where automated accounts can manipulate online conversations and spread false information, you have the power to make a difference. With OpenSocialMonitor, you can:

- **Stand Up for Truth**: Identify automated manipulation where it happens and warn others before misinformation spreads
- **Protect Your Communities**: Monitor accounts with suspicious behavior and expose bot networks trying to create artificial consensus
- **Provide Transparency**: Share evidence of manipulation to help others recognize when they're being targeted

```bash
# Monitor an account where you've noticed suspicious activity
python -m src.add_account add "suspicious_account"
python -m src.monitor --account "suspicious_account"

# Analyze a viral post that seems artificially amplified
python -m src.monitor --post "https://www.instagram.com/p/EXAMPLE/"
 ```

### Community-Powered Digital Safety

It's time we stop relying solely on commercial platforms to protect online discourse. These companies often have financial incentives that compete with user safety and information integrity. OpenSocialMonitor puts the power of detection and transparency directly in the hands of communities:

- Create accountability where platform moderation falls short
- Build collective knowledge about manipulation tactics
- Protect vulnerable communities targeted by coordinated campaigns
- Establish community-driven standards for authentic engagement

Every time you expose manipulation, you're helping protect the authentic human conversations that democracy depends on. OpenSocialMonitor puts that power in your hands.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    # ... (same as before)
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    # ... (same as before)
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # (Note: This now includes celery and redis-py)
    ```
4.  **Install & Run Redis:** This project requires a Redis server for background task queuing. The recommended way is using Docker:
    ```bash
    # Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name opensocialmonitor-redis redis
    ```

5.  **Set up your environment variables**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your Instagram credentials AND ensure
    # CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0" is present and correct.
    ```

6.  **Initialize the database:**
    The database file (`instagram_bot_monitor.db`) and its tables will be created automatically the first time you run a command that interacts with the database (e.g., `python -m src.add_account list`). No separate setup step is required.

## üìö Usage Guide

**IMPORTANT RUNTIME REQUIREMENT:**

OpenSocialMonitor now uses background tasks for monitoring reliability and performance. This requires **two separate processes** running concurrently in different terminals:

1.  **The Celery Worker:** This process executes the actual monitoring tasks (fetching posts/comments, analysis). Start it **first** and keep it running in its own terminal:
    ```bash
    # In Terminal 1 (activate virtualenv first)
    celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=INFO [-P solo]
    ```
    *(Note: `-P solo` might be needed on macOS, optional otherwise).*

2.  **The Dispatcher/Command Script:** Run your desired action (`monitor`, `add_account`, etc.) in a **separate** terminal. This script will now finish quickly by sending the job to the worker.

---

### Monitoring Social Media

*(Run these commands in Terminal 2 after starting the Celery worker in Terminal 1)*

```bash
# Monitor a specific post (sends task to worker)
python -m src.monitor --post "https://www.instagram.com/p/EXAMPLE/"

# Monitor recent posts from an account (sends task to worker)
python -m src.monitor --account "target_account" --posts 3

# Monitor all tracked accounts (sends tasks to worker)
python -m src.monitor

### Managing Accounts to Monitor

```bash
# Add an account to monitor
python -m src.add_account add "target_account"

# List all monitored accounts
python -m src.add_account list

# Enable monitoring for an account
python -m src.add_account enable "target_account"

# Disable monitoring for an account
python -m src.add_account disable "target_account"

### Reviewing and Responding to Bots

```bash
# List pending bot warnings
python -m src.review_bots

# View details about a specific detection
python -m src.review_bots view 123

# Approve and send a warning comment (sends task to worker)
python -m src.review_bots approve 123

# Reject a detection (updates DB directly)
python -m src.review_bots reject 123

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome and needed! Here's how you can help:

### Extending to New Platforms

The system is designed for easy platform expansion. To add support for a new platform:

1. Create a new connector in `src/platforms/`
2. Implement the required methods (see `instagram.py` for reference)
3. Update detection algorithms for platform-specific signals if needed

### Improving Detection Algorithms

Detection can always be enhanced:

1. Add new indicators in `src/detection/indicators.py`
2. Improve coordination detection with new patterns
3. Fine-tune thresholds and weights

### Adding Features

Some ideas for new features:

- Web interface for easier monitoring
- Report generation and visualization
- Historical trend analysis
- API for integration with other tools

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines.

## üîÆ Vision & Roadmap
